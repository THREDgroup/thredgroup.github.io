        "excerpt":"Numerical simulations to predict the dynamics and performance of wave energy converters (WECs) are challenging, requiring the simulation of complex fluid-structure interactions between a WEC device and the wave environment. Full Navier-Stokes computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations coupled with a multi-body dynamics solver are an effective simulation tool for this purpose because the governing physics are modeled from first physical principles. Unfortunately, the computational resources required to perform these types of high-fidelity simulations are significant, precluding the use of CFD simulations for design optimization. One method for reducing the numerical complexity of WEC simulations is to model the hydrodynamics using a heuristic approach that uses hydrodynamic coefficients derived from frequency-domain simulations to model the relevant hydrodynamics, while simulating the motion of the WEC device in the time-domain. The primary objective of the work presented herein is to develop such a numerical tool using the multi-body 6-degree-of-freedom (6DOF) solver SimMechanics and the frequency-domain hydrodynamics code WAMIT. The numerical tool was developed so that WEC devices comprised of arbitrarily connected multiple bodies and various power-take-off (PTO) systems could be readily modeled in operational sea states. In addition, the tool was developed to allow non-linear PTO control strategies to be considered. Using the simulation tool described above, the effect of fluid memory on predicted power output is then investigated. This is accomplished through comparison of numerical results with and without fluid memory.  ","categories": [],

        "title": "Research and Practice Group Methodology: A Case Study in Student Success.",
        "excerpt":"Experiential learning is a key component in engineering education. In civil engineering, this component is typically delivered through multiple projects. These projects may include term projects for individual courses, senior design projects, theses, or independent studies. The focus of these experiences may gradually shift from practice-oriented projects in undergraduate studies to research-oriented projects in graduate studies. Thus, learning objectives should always address both areas with a strong emphasis on common fields, such as applied research. Experiential learning has the capacity to include various program-level outcomes, such as technical knowledge, communication and teamwork. Development of a research and practice group facilitates these outcomes by creating an environment to share the learning experience. Such a group should replicate the working environment of civil engineers by incorporating multidisciplinary projects and diverse individuals, including cross-generational members. As a case study, this work examines a Research and Practice Group at California State University Fresno. This group consists of junior and senior undergraduates, graduate students, and former members who are participating as alumni. The major focus of research within the group is resilient and sustainable structural mechanics and design. This paper outlines the methodology that has been employed to ensure academic and professional success for members of the group. This methodology incorporates a recruitment process, meetings, consultation, mentorship, networking, and support. The level of student success achieved by the group is presented in terms of the achievements of the group’s members. This includes a discussion of completed projects, research funding, and group presentations. To further demonstrate the efficacy of the methodology, students in the research group are compared to the general body of engineering students at CSU Fresno though the results of a survey. This survey is analyzed using traditional methods, as well as Latent Semantic Analysis. Our results indicate that group members are better at embodying and communicating outcomes than the rest of the student body, and that the research and practice group provides an experience that allows students to internalize and take responsibility for their own goals.

From this review, it is clear that a comprehensive, rigorously validated psychometric instrument does not yet exist to assess the aptitudes, skills, knowledge, personal traits, and behaviors that are indicative of an innovative engineer.

First, we conducted a large-scale interview study involving forty-five engineering innovators with diverse backgrounds in engineering discipline, gender, ethnic, and geographic diversity.

A design team often cannot anticipate such changes, yet they pose a considerable challenge. This paper presents a study where engineering teams sought to solve a design task that was subject to two large, unexpected changes in problem formulation that occurred during problem solving. Continuous design data was collected to observe how the designers responded to the changes. We show that high- and low-performing teams demonstrated very different approaches to solving the problem and overcoming the changes. In particular, high-performing teams achieved simple designs and extensively explored small portions of the design space; low-performing teams explored complex designs with little exploration around a target area of the design space. These strategic differences are interpreted with respect to cognitive load theory and goal theory. The results raise questions as to the relationship between characteristics of design problems and solution strategies. In addition, an attempt at increasing the teams’ resilience in the face of unexpected changes is introduced by encouraging early divergent search.  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Water-lifting technologies in rural areas of the developing world have enormous potential to stimulate agricultural and economic growth. The treadle pump, a human-powered low-cost pump designed for irrigation in developing countries, can help farmers maximize financial return on small plots of land by ending their dependency on rain-fed irrigation systems. The treadle pump uses a suction piston to draw groundwater to the surface by way of a foot-powered treadle attached to each suction piston. Current treadle pump designs lift water from depths up to 7 meters at a flow-rate of 1–5 liters per second. This work seeks to optimize the design of the Dekhi style treadle pump, which has gained significant popularity due to its simplicity. A mathematical model of the working fluid and treadle pump structure has been developed in this study. Deterministic optimization methods are then employed to maximize the flow rate of the groundwater pumped, maximize the lift height, and minimize the volume of material used for manufacturing. Design variables for the optimization included the dimensions of the pump, well depth, and speed of various parts of the system. The solutions are subject to constraints on the geometry of the system, the bending stress in the treadles, and ergonomic factors. Findings indicate that significant technical improvements can be made on the standard Dekhi design, such as increasing the size of the pump cylinders and hose, while maintaining a standard total treadle length. These improvements could allow the Dekhi pump to be implemented in new regions and benefit additional rural farmers in the developing world.  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Reinforced concrete construction and steel construction are two of the most common contemporary construction methods. Both methods make use of composite decks as floor systems and diaphragms. During the design of composite decks, the interaction between the steel deck and concrete slab is typically disregarded when calculating the strength of the composite diaphragm due to lack of complete shear transfer, as existing practices such as stamping are not effective to provide substantial composite action. This conservative assumption essentially results in non-efficient use of material. This paper presents a method for ensuring shear transfer through the use of conventional sheet metal screws, driven through the corrugated steel deck and embedded in the fresh concrete. This method is proposed for use in the field between formed steel beams. Both experimental and analytical studies support an increase in strength with the addition of embedded fasteners. Further, experimental results indicate an additional increase in strength with the addition of synthetic reinforcing fibers. The increase in strength with the addition of the fasteners is on the order of 100%. When fasteners are already in use, the addition of synthetic reinforcing fibers can increase strength on the order of 10%. The ultimate deflection of enhanced deck is comparable to deck tested without fasteners, but the initial stiffness of enhanced deck is much higher.  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Design thinking is a popular design methodology that encourages iterative problem solving and fosters the creation of human-centered products. The design thinking method, born at the famous product development firm, IDEO, is intentionally loosely structured and fast paced, forcing designers to rapidly prototype and test potential solutions. With its less structured format, design thinking may be more appealing and more readily accepted and adopted by some individuals than others - as anecdotal evidence collected from design classrooms and design thinking workshops seems to indicate. The aim of this study is to determine whether student receptivity to design thinking might be linked to individual cognitive characteristics that reflect innate structural preferences. This research could help educators determine the most appropriate design methodology based on the cognitive preferences of their students, as well as the need to teach coping strategies when students are required to engage in design activities that do not align with their natural cognitive preferences. Our work presents the results of data gathered during a design thinking workshop in which students engaged in the design thinking process by working through a real world challenge. Student receptivity was evaluated using an ecological mood assessment,1 and cognitive characteristics were assessed using the KAI, which evaluates the cognitive styles of individuals2. A statistically significant relationship was observed between cognitive style and the happiness and excitement scores (two subscales of the ecological momentary mood assessment); we feel that with future experiments, even more correlations might be discovered.

However, most existing communication solutions lack flexibility and are not robust enough in disconnected, interrupted, or remote communication environments. Traditional communication tools fail to meet the increasingly complex needs of both public safety and private industry workers during emergency response. The Department of Homeland Security has sponsored the Pennsylvania State University and MIT Lincoln Laboratory to develop and prototype a new communication solution to operate in these disadvantaged environments, defined herein as emergency instances in which cellular or other typical modes of communication are down. Previous research has explored the communication methods and the dynamics of information exchange on first response teams. This work focuses on comparing the needs of alternative users, defined as non-first response organizations such as the American Red Cross, with the needs of the previously studied user group (first response teams). Survey responses and interviews enabled the exploration of current practices, with an emphasis on identifying the differences and similarities amongst the various user groups. Low-fidelity and medium-fidelity prototypes were created based on the interview and survey responses and were field-tested in order to gather user feedback. Design recommendations emphasizing day-to-day use were then developed and assessed by the user groups. These recommendations tailor the communication interfaces to better meet the needs of a variety of users resulting in more efficient and effective emergency response.  ","categories": [],

These methods include the use of content experts, reviews of existing instruments, and lists of behaviors and descriptors commonly associated with the construct(s) we wish to assess. Unfortunately, however, item creation sometimes becomes overly dependent upon a researcher’s personal attitudes about the construct(s) being tested, or on “borrowing” items from other instruments that may or may not be sound measures of the construct(s) of interest. These risks are particularly likely for new researchers in engineering education, who may have little experience with best practices in social science research. One way to support best practices in the development of new surveys and assessments is to use an instrument blueprint to guide the creation of items, as well as the collection of validity evidence. This paper outlines a process for instrument blueprint creation and content validation to help support best practices in educational assessment. Based on Messick’s unified theory of validity1, the instrument blueprint includes a process for item construction that incorporates multiple resources, including: (1) the views of content experts; (2) research from the relevant domain of interest; (3) reviews of existing instruments; and (4) the expertise of the research team. This paper uses the development of a new instrument to measure engineering innovativeness as an illustrative example of the blueprinting process. Our new instrument will assess 20 characteristics of innovative engineers as identified by in-depth studies of expert engineering innovators in previous research2.

A computational model of design teams that has been shown to effectively emulate human team behavior is leveraged to pinpoint optimized team characteristics for solving a variety of fluid and structural design problems. The nature of each design problem is characterized with respect to local and global behavior of the design space, alignment between objective functions, and the resources allotted for solving the problem. Regression analysis is used to create equations for predicting optimized team characteristics based on problem properties. These equations, which enable the informed design of design teams based on those characteristics, describe statistically significant relationships and are found to have useful levels of accuracy.

This work explores the sequencing of operations specifically within the domain of engineering design by examining the results of a human study in which participants designed trusses. A statistical analysis of the data from that study uses Markov Chains to show with high confidence that meaningful operation sequences exist. This work also uses an agent-based modeling framework in conjunction with Markov Chain concepts to simulate the performance of teams with and without the ability to learn sequences.

        "excerpt":"Poverty affects hundreds of millions of people globally. Market-based strategies can help alleviate poverty in developing countries by encouraging entrepreneurial activity and have the potential to be more effective than traditional approaches, such as development aid from countries or non-governmental organizations. Development organizations often target the agricultural sector because of the prevalence of subsistence and small-scale farming, particularly in rural regions of developing countries. Improving the reliability of irrigation techniques can help farmers expand out of primarily subsistence farming and begin to sell a portion of their crop, thus achieving the objectives of market-based poverty alleviation. Human-powered pumps are a popular tool used in irrigation because they require low capital cost and negligible operating cost. Previous work provided a model for finding Pareto-optimal IDE-style treadle pump designs. This work utilizes that model to produce a dense set of Pareto-optimal designs, and then investigates the robustness of the designs by simulating their performance in a variety of modified use scenarios. Our results show that pumps optimized for low flow rates (less than 3.0 L/s) are highly robust, particularly with respect to age-related changes in the operator’s stature or mobility. In addition, these pumps can operate with near-optimal efficiency across a variety of target flow rates and well depths. These pumps are ideal for single family use or for shared use amongst multiple families in a village. Pumps optimized for flow rates greater than 3.0 L/s are less robust with respect to changes of operator stature (experiencing decreases in flow rate of up to 60%) but may be suitable for use on farms or by service providers.

        "title": "The Prototype for X (PFX) Framework: Assessing Its Impact on Students' Prototyping Awareness",
        "excerpt":"Each year, billions of dollars are invested by large companies in product research and design. Studies indicate that anywhere from 40-50% of those resources are wasted on cancelled products or those which yield poor results. The largest sunk cost of product development occurs during the prototyping phase of the design process, yet engineering design research has largely overlooked this pivotal stage in the design process. This study is a portion of a larger project based on a new theoretical framework for prototyping called Prototype for X or PFX. PFX draws from human centered design (HCD), design thinking (DT) and Design for X (DFX) frameworks and methods to enhance the design process and allow designers to prototype more effectively. Among the anticipated impacts of PFX is increased confidence in one’s prototyping skills, i.e., increased confidence in one’s ability to develop prototypes for different conditions. The research described here marks the first step in testing this hypothesis, namely, exploring the impact of PFX on students’ prototyping awareness. In this study, students at a large Mid-Atlantic university were taught three prototyping lenses based on the PFX methodology: (1) Prototyping for Viability, (2) Prototyping for Feasibility, and (3) Prototyping for Desirability. This paper presents preliminary findings on the relationship between the these three prototyping lenses and students’ prototyping awareness, which we define as students’ ability to identify their mental models during the prototyping process. We use prototyping awareness as a proxy to measure adoption and implementation of PFX methods. The Prototyping Awareness Scale, or PAWS was created for this study, and we discuss its internal consistency and future iterations. Data were collected throughout the course of a semester-long design project; the PAWS was distributed at the conclusion of each PFX learning module. Results from both between and within subject experiments are presented.  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"The performance of a team with the right characteristics can exceed the mere sum of the constituent members’ individual efforts. However, a team having the wrong characteristics may perform more poorly than the sum of its individuals. Therefore, it is vital that teams are assembled and managed properly in order to maximize performance. This work examines how the properties of configuration design problems can be leveraged to select the best values for team characteristics (specifically team size and interaction frequency). A computational model of design teams which has been shown to effectively emulate human team behavior is employed to pinpoint optimized team characteristics for solving a variety of configuration design problems. These configuration design problems are characterized with respect to the local and global structure of the design space, the alignment between objectives, and the resources allotted for solving the problem. Regression analysis is then used to create equations for predicting optimized values for team characteristics based on problem properties. These equations achieve moderate to high accuracy, making it possible to design teams based on those problem properties. Further analysis reveals hypotheses about how the problem properties can influence a team’s search for solutions. This work also conducts a cognitive study on a different problem to test the predictive equations. For a configuration problem of moderate size, the model predicts that zero interaction between team members should lead to the best outcome. A cognitive study of human teams verifies this surprising prediction, offering partial validation of the predictive theory.  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"The design process often requires work by teams, rather than individuals. During team based design it is likely that situations will arise in which individual members of the team have different opinions, yet a group decision must still be made. Unfortunately, Arrow’s impossibility theorem indicates that there is no method for aggregating group preferences that will always satisfy a small number of ‘fair’ conditions. This work seeks to identify methods of combining individual preferences that can come close to satisfying Arrow’s conditions, enabling decisions that are fairer in practice. First, experiential conjoint analysis was used to obtain individual empirical utility functions for drinking mug designs. Each empirical utility function represented individual members who were part of a design team. Then, a number of functions for constructing group preference were analysed using both randomly generated preferences and empirical preferences derived from the experiential conjoint survey. The analysis involved checking each of Arrow’s conditions, as well as assessing the potential impact of strategic voting. Based on the results, methods that should be used to aggregate group preference within a design team in practice were identified and recommended.  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Designers often search for new solutions by iteratively adapting a current design. By engaging in this search, designers not only improve solution quality but also begin to learn what operational patterns might improve the solution in future iterations. Previous work in psychology has demonstrated that humans can fluently and adeptly learn short operational sequences that aid problem-solving. This paper explores how designers learn and employ sequences within the realm of engineering design. Specifically, this work analyzes behavioral patterns in two human studies in which participants solved configuration design problems. Behavioral data from the two studies is first analyzed using Markov chains to determine how much representation complexity is necessary to quantify the sequential patterns that designers employ during solving. It is discovered that first-order Markov chains are capable of accurately representing designers’ sequences. Next, the ability to learn first-order sequences is implemented in an agent-based modeling framework to assess the performance implications of sequence-learning abilities. These computational studies confirm the assumption that the ability to learn sequences is beneficial to designers.  ","categories": [],

The guiding goal is to extract beneficial design process heuristics that are generalizable to the entire class of problems. The extraction of these human problem-solving heuristics is automated through the application of hidden Markov models to the data from two behavioral studies.

        "excerpt":"The performance of a team is highly dependent on how the team is structured, how individuals in the team communicate with one another, and the properties exhibited by the problem being solved. It is generally assumed that teams are a superior approach in problem-solving and design. However, this work shows that for a configuration design problem of moderate size, the optimal approach for a homogenous team is in fact for members of the team to work independently, with the best solution from the individuals chosen at the end. Moreover, this work demonstrates that this surprising strategy can be predicted from knowledge of the problem’s properties through a computationally-derived set of response surfaces. First, a novel design problem is defined that requires solvers to create a system of internet-connected products to maintain the temperature within a home. Next, the characteristics of this new design problem are measured, and a computationally-derived response surface yields the untraditional prediction that teams should not interact while solving the problem. Finally, this prediction is tested and shown correct through a cognitive study. This work makes two contributions to the state of the art. First, it provides verification of a methodology that allows optimal team characteristics to be predicted based on knowledge of a design problem. Second, it demonstrates an additional problem instance for which interacting teams are inferior to nominal teams (adding to a growing literature to that effect).  ","categories": [],

The current work proposes a methodology for rapidly evaluating and synthesizing engineered systems through the use of deep neural networks. The proposed methodology is applied to the analysis and synthesis of offshore structures such as oil platforms.

Human-powered water pumps have been used with great success in this rapidly developing market. KickStart’s MoneyMaker Hip Pump is a human-powered water pump with additional design features that make it lightweight and portable for use in remote fields in several countries throughout Africa. This work first applied numerical optimization techniques to the design of the MoneyMaker Hip Pump and offers further improvements to its design. Deterministic multi-objective optimization methods were employed to maximize the flow rate of the pump, maximize the pumping height of water, and minimize cost. Following optimization, the robustness of the optimized pump design was analyzed under several modified scenarios, including fouling of the hoses and a decrease in operator power due to fatigue or aging. The set of cost-optimized pump designs was then compared to a second set of optimal designs that was found using material volume as a simplified proxy for the cost objective function. Findings indicate that several technical improvements can be made to the current MoneyMaker Hip Pump design to reduce cost by up to 37% without affecting water flow rate, or increase water flow rate by up to 88% without increasing cost. The numerical model was validated through physical experimentation of the MoneyMaker Hip Pump, and design alterations to reduce cost were experimentally shown to maintain pump performance.

Thus, the goal of this study was to investigate the impact of the type(s) of product dissected in a team environment on the breadth of the design space explored and the underlying influence of educational level on these effects.

The results of the study highlight that simulated senior engineering design teams explored a larger solution space than first-year teams and that dissecting different types of products allowed for the exploration of a larger solution space for all of the simulated teams. The results also showed that dissecting two analogically far products and two simple products was most effective in expanding the solution space of simulated senior engineering design teams, but this was not necessarily the case for first-year teams.

        "excerpt":"Early stages of the engineering design process are vital to shaping the final design; each subsequent step builds from the initial concept. Innovation-driven engineering problems require designers to focus heavily on early-stage design generation, with constant application and evaluation of design changes. Strategies to reduce the amount of time and effort designers spend in this phase could improve the efficiency of the design process as a whole. This paper seeks to create and demonstrate a two-tiered design grammar that encodes heuristic strategies to aid in the generation of early solution concepts. Specifically, this two-tiered grammar mimics the combination of heuristic-based strategic actions and parametric modifications employed by human designers. Rules in the higher-tier are abstract and potentially applicable to multiple design problems across a number of fields. These abstract rules are translated into a series of lower-tier rule applications in a spatial design grammar, which are inherently domain-specific. This grammar is implemented within the HSAT agent-based algorithm. Agents iteratively select actions from either the higher-tier or lower-tier. This algorithm is applied to the design of wave energy converters, devices which use the motion of ocean waves to generate electrical power. Comparisons are made between designs generated using only lower-tier rules and those generated using only higher-tier rules.  ","categories": [],

Our assessment improves alignment with common learning objectives found in first-year engineering design courses and additionally prepares students for the type of case study interviews that are increasingly common for entry-level engineering jobs. To evaluate our assessment, 50 first-year students completed the engineering design self-efficacy instrument once before beginning the assessment and a second time approximately 48 hours later upon completion of a reflection assignment. In addition, students retrospectively reported their perceived change in self-efficacy during the assessment. Analysis shows that students perceived a large retrospective increase in skill level, despite only a small increase in directly measured self-efficacy. These results are analyzed in light of the Dunning-Kruger effect and we posit that the assessment helps to align students’ self-efficacy with their actual skill level. Increased alignment of self-efficacy with skill level may minimize student frustration when encountering challenging tasks in the future, potentially increasing retention of engineering students as well as facilitating the development of lifelong learning attitudes.

Some studies have explored the errors inherent in higher fidelity scan to print (S2P) processes, yet few have explored the errors in S2P processes that leverage affordable rapid non-contact digitizers. No studies have explored the strategies experts in digital fabrication employ to mitigate geometric and dimensional errors throughout the S2P process. To address these gaps, a controlled study was conducted using data from 27 scans collected with a common off-the-shelf non-contact optical digitizer and a relatively simple workpiece. Additionally, a behavioral study was conducted with 13 experts in digital fabrication; actions were recorded and later analyzed using hidden Markov modeling. The geometric and dimensional integrity of the digital models was found to be significantly out of tolerance at various phases of the S2P process, as compared to the truth model. Larger errors were found more consistently in the beginning of the S2P process, but these errors were not sufficiently filtered out during the remainder of the process. Experts strategies were not beneficial and digital models produced by experts were found to be significantly smaller than truth models, indicating a trend to “over-clean” digital models.

        "excerpt":"Additive Manufacturing (AM) allows designers to create intricate geometries that were once too complex or expensive to achieve through traditional manufacturing processes.  Currently, Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM) is restricted to experts in the field, and novices may overlook potentially transformational design potential enabled by AM. This project aims to make DfAM accessible to a broader audience through deep learning, enabling designers of all skill levels to leverage unique AM geometries when creating new designs.  To demonstrate such an approach, a database of files was acquired from industry-sponsored AM challenges focused on lightweight design.  These files were converted to a voxelized format, which provides more robust information for machine learning applications. Next, an autoencoder was constructed to a low-dimensional representation of the part designs.  Finally, that autoencoder was used to construct a deep neural network capable of predicting various DfAM attributes.  This work demonstrates a novel foray towards a more extensive DfAM support system that supports designers at all experience levels.  ","categories": [],

        "title": "Us Versus Me: An Analysis of Team Process and Performance in Distributed Data Science Challenges",
        "excerpt":"Crowdsourced competitions have seen increased used for software development and data science, and platforms often encourage teamwork between participants. This is unsurprising - teams are ubiquitous, woven into the fabric of engineering and design. Often, it is assumed that teams are better at solving problems than individuals working independently. However, recent work in engineering, design, and psychology has indicated that teams may not be the problem-solving panacea that they were once thought to be. This work undertakes an analysis of the performance of different team styles and sizes in crowdsourced data science competitions. This work demonstrates that groups of individuals working independently may outperform interacting teams on average, but that small interacting teams are more likely to win competitions. These results are discussed in the context of motivation for crowdsourcing participants, and semantic analysis of forum posts is presented to uncover the internal machinery of both and high- and low-performing teams.

        "excerpt":"This note explores fundamental assumptions of engineering design methodology and theory that are called into question by recent work. This piece is centered around five questions that highlight the assumptions that we explore. These are (1) Are teams teams? (2) Is search good? (3) Are analogies analogous? and (4) Is novelty novel? (5) Is fixation fixated?  Our intent is to generate critical discourse around these topics and encourage the community to continue to challenge underlying assumptions.  ","categories": [],
