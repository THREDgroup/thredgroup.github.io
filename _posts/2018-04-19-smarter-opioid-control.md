excerpt: "On Jan. 10, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf declared the heroin and opioid epidemic a statewide disaster emergency. According to data from the Drug Enforcement Agency, the number of fatal drug overdoses in Pennsylvania in 2016 was 4,642, a 37 percent increase from 2015. This increase is attributed to the number of fatalities caused by fentanyl and other similar opioids overdoses."
