This paper explores the development of social emotional learning (SEL) solutions created by two design teams.
Both teams combined methods from design thinking, empathetic design, rapid prototyping, and evidence-based
prevention to answer the complex question: How might we support social and emotional development in young
children (ages 3-6)? The two teams approached the problem in the same way, but varied the environment of the
end-users between homes and childcare centers. The purpose of this paper is to reflect on the two distinct
design cases and indicate noteworthy characteristics from them. In particular, we hope to increase and
encourage the translation of evidence-based research into real world solutions.
