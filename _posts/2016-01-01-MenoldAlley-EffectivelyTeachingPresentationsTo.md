Much research has gone into developing different strategies for teaching writing and speaking to engineering and science students. However, many of these strategies are designed for semester-long courses, in which a communication expert teaches fewer than 30 students. This extended abstract describes a study in which we test a different strategy for effectively teaching presentations to large numbers of engineering and science students in a relatively short time. Because the strategy calls for students to use the assertion-evidence approach, as opposed to the common topic-subtopic practice, the strategy is challenging. In our study, we are testing the strategy in four large student populations in workshops ranging from two days to one week.
