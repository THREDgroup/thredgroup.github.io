excerpt: "For companies developing new products, creating a physical prototype is a risky undertaking. If a prototype fails, the time and monetary resources put behind it are wasted, meaning designers, engineers and companies must put more time and money into creating a new prototype for testing. For large companies like Johnson & Johnson, a diverse product portfolio means millions of dollars and hundreds of hours a year may be lost to failed prototypes. Jessica Menold, assistant professor of engineering design and mechanical engineering, aims to change that."
