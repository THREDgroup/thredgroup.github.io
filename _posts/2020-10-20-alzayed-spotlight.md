excerpt: "Mohammad AlSager AlZayed always knew that he wanted to be an engineer, but he didnâ€™t realize his passion for engineering education until he began his academic career at Penn State. AlZayed came to the Harold and Inge Marcus Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering in 2012 because he wanted to earn his degree from the first ever industrial engineering department in the world."
