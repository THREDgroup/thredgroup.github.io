excerpt: "The Arctic sea is consuming Alaska’s coastline. Since 1955, the rising water has eroded more than 300 meters of permafrost — the frozen soil that helps protect the Arctic’s delicately balanced ecosystem. It also serves as the foundation upon which hundreds of villages and thousands of people exist. "
